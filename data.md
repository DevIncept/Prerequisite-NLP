**NLP**(_Natural Language processing_):Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.  

**Applications**
* Search Autocorrect and Autocomplete
* Sentiment Analysis(_Will see it in our course_)
* Email Filtering(_spam checking_)
* ATS system(_Application tracking system_)
* ChatBots  

**Corpus** : Body of text, singular. Corpora is the plural of this.  
**Lexicon** : Words and their meanings.  
**Token** : Each “entity” that is a part of whatever was split up based on rules.  

**NLTK**(_Natural Language toolkit_):The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).
It contains text processing libraries for-  
* Tokenization:_Tokenization is breaking the raw text into small chunks. Tokenization breaks the raw text into words, sentences called tokens_.  
> For example, the text "Rasode me kon tha" can be tokenized into 'Rasode','me','kon','tha'  
* Parsing:_Parsing in NLP is the process of determining the syntactic structure of a text by analyzing its constituent words based on an underlying grammar (of the language)._
* Stemming:_Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers._
>  A stemming algorithm reduces the words “chocolates”, “chocolatey”, “choco” to the root word, “chocolate” and “retrieval”, “retrieved”, “retrieves” reduce to the stem "retrieve".  
* Tagging:_Tagging is an essential feature of text processing where we tag the words into grammatical categorization._  
> Input: Everything to permit us.
> Output: [('Everything', NN),('to', TO), ('permit', VB), ('us', PRP)]
